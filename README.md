Chaos Rings III Mod for Terraria is built based on this exciting Japanese RPG-style game, Chaos Rings III, using [tModLoader](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki). The original game is downloadable on Android and iOS. Though now the game is known by few, we still want to combine the rich combat elements (and perhaps some of the plot) with the sandbox nature of Terraria. 

This repository has its linked project.
